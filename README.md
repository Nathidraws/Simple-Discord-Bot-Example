This is the most basic bot code you will find.
It just puts the bot online.


All you need to do is put your bots token in Bot.js and run the bot. :)



Help:

node_modules        -  The discord.js stuff. Created by running: npm install discord.js


package-lock.json   -  I believe it's part of whats installed when running discord.js. Leave it how it is.


Bot.js              -  What runs the bot. It contains the token. You find that here: https://discord.com/developers/applications


Run.bat             -  Batch file that runs the Bot.js file. (@echo off   node Bot.js)  If there is no token in Bot.js, it won't run.
